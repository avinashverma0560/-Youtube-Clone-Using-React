<h2>🧐 Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's 💹best features:

 1. **✅Video Streaming:** The project is a replica of the YouTube platform including its UI design and functionalities.The app also supports lazy loading to enhance performance. Users can browse and stream YouTube videos seamlessly within the application.
2. **✅Real-time Search Suggestions:** As the user types in the search bar the app displays a dropdown list of suggested search queries. This feature enhances the user experience and makes it easier to find relevant videos.
3. **✅Search Caching:** To improve performance and reduce the number of API calls made the app caches the results of previous searches. This means that if a user makes the same search query twice the app will fetch the results from the cache instead of making a new API call.
4. **✅Optimized Search Using Caching and Debouncing:** The app uses debouncing to optimize the search functionality. This means that instead of making an API call for every key press in the search bar the app waits until the user has stopped typing before making the API call. Additionally the app uses caching to fetch the results of previous searches faster.
5. **✅Optimized API Calls Using Debouncing:** The app uses debouncing to optimize API calls throughout the app. For example when a user scrolls through the video list the app waits until the user has stopped scrolling before fetching more videos. This feature reduces the number of API calls made and improves performance.
6. **✅Comments on YouTube:** The app includes a comments section that allows users to view comments on a video. The comments are fetched from the YouTube API and are displayed in a threaded view to enhance readability.
7.   **✅Live Chat of YouTube -** Get Data Live Update UI Continuously Developed with API Polling: The app includes a live chat feature that allows users to view and send messages in real-time. The chat is implemented using API polling which means that the app regularly makes API calls to fetch new messages and updates the UI accordingly.
8.   **✅State-of-the-Art Styling:** The application boasts a visually appealing and responsive design achieved through Tailwind CSS.
9.  **✅Redux State Management:** The use of Redux Toolkit ensures efficient state management providing a smooth and predictable user experience.
10.   **✅Video Download:** A custom Node.js server enables users to download videos to their device galleries for offline viewing.
11. **✅Themes:** Added dark theme and light theme.
12.  **✅Voice Search:** Added voice search functionality.
13.   **✅Video Suggestion in watch page:** Implemented video suggestion in video wached page

## Technologies Used
-  **🟢React** : The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React provides a component-based architecture, making it easy to create modular and reusable UI components.

- **🟢Redux Toolkit:** :State management is handled efficiently with Redux Toolkit, ensuring a predictable state container for the application. This helps in managing the application's state in a scalable and maintainable way.

- **🟢Tailwind CSS**: The styling of the application is powered by Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework. Tailwind CSS allows for rapid development with its pre-defined utility classes, making it easy to create a responsive and visually appealing user interface.

- **🟢YouTube API:** The application utilizes the YouTube API to fetch video data, display video content, and handle user interactions. This integration allows users to browse and watch YouTube videos seamlessly within the application.

- **🟢Search Suggestion API:**  For an enhanced user experience, a search suggestion API is integrated to provide real-time search suggestions as users type in the search bar. This feature makes the search process more intuitive and user-friendly.

- **🟢Node.js:** A small Node.js server is implemented to handle video downloads. This server facilitates the download of videos to the user's device gallery, enhancing the offline viewing experience.
